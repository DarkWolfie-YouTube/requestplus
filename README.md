## 🧠 Overview  
**Request+** is a free and open-source tool designed for Twitch streamers who want seamless, real-time song requests integrated directly with Spotify.  
Built with **React** and **Electron**, Request+ provides a smooth desktop experience — while **Spicetify** handles communication with Spotify for playback and track control.

It’s simple, free, and streamer-focused. No subscriptions. No ads. Just you, your chat, and your music.
