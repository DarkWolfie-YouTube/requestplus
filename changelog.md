# Request+ v1.1.2

## Major Bug fix and feature Addition.

## Added
- Guess The song Support! Now chat can play Guess the song


## Fixes
- Fixed a bug where some authentication wouldn't work or login properly. (Mainly Kick)
- Fixed a bug where Youtube's repeat mode was null.
- Fixed a bug where Kick chat wouldn't initialize when token was invalid.
- Fixed a bug that made it where chat wasn't activated once logged into Twitch or Kick
- Fixed a issue where the queue page will show for youtube clients. (Youtube's Queue object is complicated so moderation queues will not work.)



## Guess the song Feature Info

Around 1 second before the next song starts, the overlay will display a message detailing that the guess the song is active and ready. During this time, viewers have 30 seconds after the next song starts to guess the song.

Using commands like !guess with the song name, allows users to guess the song. Make sure to link the playlist you are using in chat or a bio feature so that guessers have a fair chance to play.

This will also store the stats of players who correctly guess the song and who doesn't (does not store anything if no one guesses it unless the command is ran.) COMING SOON

THIS IS A SPOTIFY ONLY FEATURE
