# 🚀 Request+ v1.2.2

---

# Overlay Update!

- Instead of showing the overlay all the time, the overlay can now show the new song playing and dissapear after 10 seconds
  - These options are now new themes, they work just like the regular themes.

I plan on adding a UI object for this overlay detailing what song got added to the queue. Keep a look out for a testers button in settings!
